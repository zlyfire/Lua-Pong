# Lua-Pong
Just a little Lua-based pong game. Currently only for two players.

The game runs good enough for my liking. The Options menu is currently blank, so clicking it will currently leave you stranded.
To start a new game, click the button. To start each round, hit the space bar to start the ball's movement.
Controls are simple:

  The menu screen uses the mouse, the game uses the keyboard.
	
  Space starts the ball each round.
  
  Player 1 uses the W and S keys to move Up and Down, respectively (left side paddle).
  
  Player 2 uses the Up and Down keys to move Up and Down, respectively (right side paddle).
  
  Escape will close the game.
